The above plots show the 2N3055 Ic collector current is controlled by the Ib base current and the Vce collector emitter voltage has very little effect on the Ic collector current after getting out of the cut off area.    
    
Above screen
  + The bright dot in the lower left corner is 0 voltage at 0 current. 
    + The horziontal voltage scale is 500 mV/div.
      + Vc (collertor voltage) ranges for 0 V to 4.5 V.
    + The vertical current scale is 500 mV/ 100 ohms = 5 mA/div.
      + Ic (collector current) ranges from 0 A to 35 mA.
  + Each horzional trace is a different Ib (base current) current. Base current starting from the top.
    + Ib 2.348 mA, Ic 35 mA, hFE 14.9

### [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT): What is a High Endurance Video microSDXC Card?
    
A High Endurance Video microSDXC (Secure Digital Extended Capacity) card is a type of memory card specifically designed for applications that require continuous and high-quality video recording. It is built to withstand the rigorous demands of constant video recording, making it ideal for use in surveillance cameras, dashcams, body cameras, drones, and other devices that require extended durability.

The key feature of a High Endurance Video microSDXC card is its ability to handle a high number of write cycles without experiencing performance degradation or failure. Regular microSD cards are typically designed for general-purpose use and may not be able to sustain continuous video recording for extended periods.

High Endurance Video microSDXC cards are built with high-quality NAND flash memory and advanced firmware algorithms, which allow them to handle the constant write operations associated with video recording. They have enhanced durability, better temperature resistance, and improved error correction capabilities to ensure data integrity over long periods.

These cards often come with specific endurance ratings, denoting the number of hours or terabytes written (TBW) that the card can endure. The endurance rating helps users estimate the card's lifespan and choose an appropriate card based on their recording needs.

It's important to note that High Endurance Video microSDXC cards may have slower read and write speeds compared to regular microSD cards optimized for other applications, such as fast data transfer or high-resolution photography. Therefore, when choosing a memory card, it's crucial to consider the intended purpose and prioritize endurance and reliability over speed.    
    
### [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT): Compare a normal microSD Card with a High Endurance Video microSDXC card when they wear out.
    
When a normal microSD card and a High Endurance Video microSDXC card reach their maximum write endurance and wear out, there are some key differences in their behavior and performance. Here's a comparison:

1. Endurance: A normal microSD card typically has a lower endurance rating compared to a High Endurance Video microSDXC card. The high endurance card is specifically designed to withstand continuous and intensive write operations associated with video recording, so it generally has a much higher endurance rating, measured in terms of hours or terabytes written (TBW).

2. Lifespan: Due to its higher endurance, a High Endurance Video microSDXC card has a longer lifespan than a regular microSD card. It can sustain a significantly larger number of write cycles before reaching its wear-out point. This means that it can be used for longer periods of time without needing replacement.

3. Performance degradation: When a normal microSD card reaches its wear-out point, it may start experiencing performance degradation. This can manifest as slower write speeds, increased errors, or even data corruption. On the other hand, a High Endurance Video microSDXC card is designed to maintain its performance and data integrity even after extensive use. While it will eventually wear out like any other storage medium, it tends to offer more consistent and reliable performance throughout its lifespan.

4. Failure modes: When a normal microSD card reaches the end of its life, it is more prone to sudden failures or becoming unreadable. This can result in data loss or the card becoming unusable. In contrast, a High Endurance Video microSDXC card is engineered to have robust error correction capabilities and better reliability, minimizing the risk of sudden failures.

In summary, a High Endurance Video microSDXC card outperforms a regular microSD card in terms of endurance, lifespan, performance consistency, and reliability. It is specifically designed to handle the demands of continuous video recording without experiencing rapid degradation or failure, providing a more reliable storage solution for applications that require extended durability.
    
### [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT): Compare Sandisk max endurance card with Sandisk high endurance card. 
    
SanDisk offers two popular lines of memory cards designed for continuous video recording: the SanDisk Max Endurance card and the SanDisk High Endurance card. Here's a comparison between these two product lines:

1. Endurance Rating: Both cards are designed for extended durability, but they have different endurance ratings. The SanDisk Max Endurance card typically offers a higher endurance rating compared to the SanDisk High Endurance card. The exact endurance ratings can vary depending on the specific models, but generally, the Max Endurance cards are designed to handle more write cycles and have a longer lifespan.

2. Usage Scenarios: The SanDisk Max Endurance card is aimed at demanding applications that require long-lasting endurance, such as continuous video surveillance or high-resolution video recording. It is suitable for use in devices like security cameras, dashcams, or drones that require reliable and robust storage. The SanDisk High Endurance card, on the other hand, is also designed for continuous video recording but is typically targeted at more consumer-grade applications, including dashcams and home security cameras.

3. Capacities: Both card lines offer a range of storage capacities to suit different needs. They are available in capacities ranging from 32GB to 256GB, allowing users to choose the appropriate size based on their storage requirements.

4. Performance: In terms of performance, both card lines offer similar read and write speeds, ensuring smooth and consistent video recording. The specific speed ratings may vary between different models within each line, but they generally meet the necessary requirements for recording high-quality video.

5. Warranty: SanDisk typically offers a warranty for both the Max Endurance and High Endurance cards. The warranty duration can vary, so it's important to check the product specifications and terms provided by SanDisk.

Overall, while both the SanDisk Max Endurance and SanDisk High Endurance cards are designed for continuous video recording, the Max Endurance line generally offers a higher endurance rating and is geared towards more demanding professional applications. The High Endurance line, while still reliable, caters to consumer-grade needs and offers a slightly lower endurance rating. It's important to consider your specific requirements and choose the card that best fits your usage scenario and endurance needs.    
    
### [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT): What is the lifespan of a normal microSD card?
    
The lifespan of a normal microSD card can vary depending on several factors, including the quality of the card, usage patterns, and environmental conditions. Generally, microSD cards have a finite lifespan determined by the number of write cycles they can endure before wearing out. Write cycles refer to the process of writing data onto the card.

The lifespan of a microSD card is often specified by its endurance rating, which is an estimation of the total amount of data that can be written to the card before it reaches its wear-out point. Endurance ratings are typically expressed in terms of hours of video recording or terabytes written (TBW).

For regular consumer-grade microSD cards, the endurance ratings can vary widely. Lower-endurance cards may have ratings ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand hours of video recording or a few tens to hundreds of terabytes written. Higher-endurance cards, including those designed for continuous video recording, can have ratings in the range of thousands of hours or several hundred terabytes written.

It's important to note that the lifespan of a microSD card is not solely determined by its endurance rating. Factors such as the frequency and intensity of usage, the type of data being written, and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.) can also impact its lifespan. Additionally, as the card ages, it may experience gradual performance degradation even before reaching its wear-out point.

To maximize the lifespan of a microSD card, it's recommended to follow best practices such as avoiding frequent and unnecessary data overwrites, using the card within its specified temperature range, and safely ejecting the card before removing it from devices. Regularly backing up important data from the card is also a good practice to prevent data loss.

Overall, while the lifespan of a normal microSD card can vary, it is generally advisable to choose a card with a higher endurance rating if you anticipate extensive or continuous usage to ensure long-term reliability.
    
### [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT): What is the lifespan of a microSD card used in a Raspberry Pi computer?    

The lifespan of a microSD card used in a Raspberry Pi computer can vary depending on several factors. Raspberry Pi computers often perform numerous read and write operations on the microSD card, which can impact its lifespan. Here are some factors that can influence the lifespan:

1. Quality of the microSD card: Higher-quality microSD cards generally tend to have better durability and endurance, meaning they can withstand more write cycles before wearing out. Opting for a reputable brand and choosing a card specifically designed for endurance, such as those labeled as "High Endurance" or "Industrial Grade," can contribute to a longer lifespan.

2. Operating system optimizations: The choice of operating system and its configuration can affect the number of write operations performed on the microSD card. Some operating systems, like Raspbian (now Raspberry Pi OS), implement measures to minimize unnecessary writes and optimize performance, which can extend the lifespan of the microSD card.

3. Write-intensive applications: If you're running applications on your Raspberry Pi that involve frequent and intensive writing to the microSD card, such as databases or logging systems, it can accelerate the wear on the card. These types of applications may lead to a shorter lifespan compared to less write-intensive uses.

4. Power loss and improper shutdowns: Abrupt power losses or improper shutdowns (e.g., pulling the power plug without shutting down the Raspberry Pi properly) can increase the risk of data corruption and potentially shorten the lifespan of the microSD card. It's important to ensure proper power management and shutdown procedures to minimize these risks.

Given these factors, it's challenging to provide an exact lifespan for a microSD card used in a Raspberry Pi. However, with regular usage and assuming a reasonably good quality microSD card, it's generally expected that the card should last for at least several months to a few years, depending on usage patterns and other factors.

To improve the lifespan of the microSD card in a Raspberry Pi, consider implementing the following best practices:

1. Choose a high-quality microSD card with good endurance ratings.
2. Optimize the operating system settings to minimize unnecessary writes.
3. Minimize write-intensive applications or consider utilizing external storage options.
4. Ensure proper power management and shutdown procedures.
5. Regularly back up important data to mitigate potential data loss.

By following these guidelines, you can help maximize the lifespan of the microSD card used in your Raspberry Pi and enhance its overall reliability.

</p>

  + Sourcing or sinking up to 25 mA (milliamperes) of current individually,    
  + A total limit of 150 mA for all GPIO pins combined.
    
### [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT): What is the maximum digital output current of a Raspberry Pi Pico?
    
The Raspberry Pi Pico is a microcontroller board that is powered by a RP2040 microcontroller chip. The RP2040 chip itself does not have a specified maximum digital output current. However, the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi Pico are capable of sourcing or sinking up to 25 mA (milliamperes) of current individually, with a total limit of 150 mA for all GPIO pins combined.

It's important to note that exceeding these limits can cause damage to the board or connected components. If you require higher current capabilities, you may need to use external components such as buffers, transistors, or dedicated driver circuits to handle the increased current requirements.  

### [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT): What is is the Mimi resistor value to use from the GPIO pin to ground?

When connecting a resistor from a GPIO pin to ground, it is commonly referred to as a pull-down resistor. The purpose of a pull-down resistor is to ensure that the GPIO pin has a defined logic level (LOW) when it is not being actively driven by the microcontroller.

For the Raspberry Pi Pico, the GPIO pins have an internal pull-down resistor that can be enabled through software configuration. This means that you do not necessarily need to add an external pull-down resistor if you enable the internal pull-down resistor in your code.

To enable the internal pull-down resistor for a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi Pico using MicroPython, you can use the following code:

```python
import machine

# Configure GPIO pin 0 with pull-down resistor
pin = machine.Pin(0, machine.Pin.IN, machine.Pin.PULL_DOWN)
```

If you prefer to use an external pull-down resistor, a commonly used value is around 10 kΩ (kiloohms). However, the actual resistor value depends on the specific requirements of your circuit and the devices connected to the GPIO pin. You may need to choose a different value based on factors such as the electrical characteristics of the connected components, desired noise immunity, and power consumption.
    
### [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT): How much current flows in the 10 kΩ external pull-down resistor when the GPIO pin is high?

When the GPIO pin is set to a HIGH logic level (3.3V for the Raspberry Pi Pico), there will be a voltage potential difference across the external pull-down resistor. To determine the current flowing through the resistor, you can use Ohm's Law, which states that current (I) is equal to the voltage (V) divided by the resistance (R):

I = V / R

In this case, the voltage across the resistor is the supply voltage minus the GPIO pin voltage. Assuming a 3.3V supply voltage and a HIGH logic level of 3.3V for the GPIO pin, the voltage across the resistor would be:

V = 3.3V - 3.3V = 0V

Substituting the values into Ohm's Law, we have:

I = 0V / 10 kΩ = 0A

Therefore, when the GPIO pin is set to a HIGH logic level, no current will flow through the 10 kΩ external pull-down resistor.
    
### [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT): How much current flows in the 10 kΩ external pull-down resistor when the GPIO pin is low?

When the GPIO pin is set to a LOW logic level (0V for the Raspberry Pi Pico), there will be a voltage potential difference across the external pull-down resistor. To determine the current flowing through the resistor, you can again use Ohm's Law:

I = V / R

In this case, the voltage across the resistor is the supply voltage (3.3V for the Raspberry Pi Pico) minus the GPIO pin voltage (0V). Thus, the voltage across the resistor is:

V = 3.3V - 0V = 3.3V

Substituting the values into Ohm's Law, we have:

I = 3.3V / 10 kΩ = 0.33 mA

Therefore, when the GPIO pin is set to a LOW logic level, approximately 0.33 mA (milliamperes) of current will flow through the 10 kΩ external pull-down resistor.
    
### [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT): What is the shortest pulse that the GPIO pin can output?

The Raspberry Pi Pico, with its RP2040 microcontroller, has highly flexible and programmable GPIO pins. The actual shortest pulse that a GPIO pin can output depends on various factors such as the programming language used, the specific code implementation, and the system clock frequency.

By default, the RP2040 microcontroller on the Raspberry Pi Pico has a system clock frequency of 125 MHz. This means that the shortest pulse that can be generated is determined by the clock period of 1/125 MHz, which is approximately 8 nanoseconds (ns).

However, achieving such a short pulse width may be challenging in practice due to various factors such as code execution time, interrupt latency, and the limitations of the programming language itself. Additionally, the accuracy and precision of the pulse width may also be influenced by external factors like the connected circuitry and its response time.

Therefore, while the theoretical shortest pulse width can be as short as 8 ns based on the system clock frequency, achieving and accurately measuring such short pulses may be difficult in practical scenarios.

# Project 187: Raspberry Pi Pico GPIO Square Wave
<p align="center">
<img align="center" width="600" height="338" src="/Images/PicoVsys1_600.png">        
</p>

### [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT): Create a MicroPython program to generate a square wave 1 Hz on a GPIO pin.

Certainly! Here's an example MicroPython program to generate a square wave with a frequency of 1 Hz on a GPIO pin of the Raspberry Pi Pico:

```python
import machine
import utime

# Define the GPIO pin number
gpio_pin = 2

# Configure the GPIO pin for output
pin = machine.Pin(gpio_pin, machine.Pin.OUT)

# Generate a square wave
while True:
    pin.value(1)  # Set the pin to HIGH
    utime.sleep(0.5)  # Delay for half a second
    
    pin.value(0)  # Set the pin to LOW
    utime.sleep(0.5)  # Delay for half a second
```

In this program, we first import the necessary modules `machine` for GPIO control and `utime` for time-related functions. Then, we define the GPIO pin number (`gpio_pin`) to which the square wave will be output.

We configure the GPIO pin as an output pin using `machine.Pin(gpio_pin, machine.Pin.OUT)`. The `pin` object represents the GPIO pin and allows us to set its value.

Inside the `while True` loop, we alternate between setting the pin value to 1 (HIGH) and 0 (LOW) using `pin.value(1)` and `pin.value(0)`, respectively. We then use `utime.sleep(0.5)` to introduce a delay of half a second, resulting in a square wave with a frequency of 1 Hz (one cycle per second).

You can modify the `gpio_pin` variable to match the GPIO pin number you intend to use for generating the square wave.
    
### [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT): Change the program by adding a variable to set the square wave frequency.

Certainly! Here's an updated version of the MicroPython program that includes a variable to set the square wave frequency:

```python
import machine
import utime

# Define the GPIO pin number
gpio_pin = 2

# Define the square wave frequency in Hz
frequency = 1

# Calculate the time period based on the frequency
period = 1 / frequency

# Configure the GPIO pin for output
pin = machine.Pin(gpio_pin, machine.Pin.OUT)

# Generate a square wave
while True:
    pin.value(1)  # Set the pin to HIGH
    utime.sleep(period / 2)  # Delay for half of the time period
    
    pin.value(0)  # Set the pin to LOW
    utime.sleep(period / 2)  # Delay for half of the time period
```

In this updated program, we added a new variable `frequency` that represents the desired square wave frequency in Hz. You can modify this variable to set the desired frequency.

Based on the specified frequency, we calculate the time period of each cycle using the formula `period = 1 / frequency`.

Inside the `while True` loop, we use `pin.value(1)` to set the GPIO pin to HIGH and `pin.value(0)` to set it to LOW. The `utime.sleep()` function is used to introduce a delay of half of the time period (`period / 2`). This ensures that the total time for each cycle (HIGH + LOW) is equal to the specified time period.

By adjusting the `frequency` variable, you can set the square wave to your desired frequency.
    
### [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT): What is the highest frequency that can be used? 

The highest frequency that can be generated by a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi Pico is influenced by various factors, including the capabilities of the RP2040 microcontroller, the programming language used, and the specific code implementation.

In general, the RP2040 microcontroller used in the Raspberry Pi Pico has a maximum clock frequency of 133 MHz. This clock frequency determines the execution speed of the code and, consequently, the fastest achievable square wave frequency.

However, it's important to note that generating very high-frequency square waves using general-purpose GPIO pins might be challenging due to factors such as the execution time of the code, interrupt latency, and the limitations of the programming language itself. Additionally, other factors, such as the electrical characteristics of the connected circuitry and the response time of the components, can also affect the achievable frequency.

Therefore, while the theoretical maximum frequency could be quite high, practical limitations make it difficult to provide a specific value. It's best to consider the specific requirements of your application and perform testing to determine the highest achievable frequency within the given constraints.
    
### [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT): What is the lowest frequency that can be used in the program? 

The lowest frequency that can be used in the program depends on several factors, including the capabilities of the RP2040 microcontroller, the programming language used, and the specific code implementation.

In general, the RP2040 microcontroller used in the Raspberry Pi Pico is capable of generating square waves with very low frequencies. The `utime.sleep()` function is commonly used to introduce delays in MicroPython code. However, the accuracy and precision of the delay introduced by `utime.sleep()` can vary based on the specific implementation and system clock frequency.

The `utime.sleep()` function typically operates with a resolution of milliseconds or microseconds, depending on the platform and the specific version of MicroPython. Achieving delays in the range of seconds or longer can be challenging with `utime.sleep()` alone.

To generate lower frequencies, you may need to use alternative approaches, such as using timers or hardware-specific features. By utilizing timer interrupts and advanced features of the RP2040 microcontroller, you can achieve lower frequencies with greater accuracy and precision.

In summary, the lowest frequency that can be used in the program is subject to various factors, including the specific implementation and the techniques employed. However, with appropriate utilization of timer interrupts and other advanced features, you can achieve lower frequencies with improved accuracy and precision.

### [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT): Create a MicroPython program that uses the PIO to output a squarewave 10 kHz on a GPIO pin.

To generate a square wave of 10 kHz using the Programmable I/O (PIO) on the Raspberry Pi Pico with MicroPython, you can utilize the PIO's state machines and programmable waveform generator. Here's an example program to accomplish this:

```python
import rp2pio
from machine import Pin

# Define the frequency and pin configuration
frequency = 10000  # 10 kHz
gpio_pin = 2

# Define the PIO program
pio_program = rp2pio.StateMachine(0, 
    freq=4 * frequency, 
    sideset_base=Pin(gpio_pin))

pio_program.init(
    rp2pio.asm_pio(
        """
        mov x, osr
        mov y, osr
        jmp loop
        
        wrap_target:
        nop
        wrap
        
        loop:
        jmp x-- wrap_target
        jmp y-- loop
        """
    ),
    freq=4 * frequency,
)

# Run the PIO program
pio_program.active(1)

# Wait indefinitely
while True:
    pass
```

In this program, we first import the necessary modules, including `rp2pio` for PIO functionality and `machine.Pin` for GPIO pin configuration. We define the desired frequency (`frequency`) as 10 kHz and specify the GPIO pin to be used (`gpio_pin`).

Next, we define the PIO program using the `rp2pio.StateMachine` class. We set the frequency of the PIO program to be four times the desired frequency (`4 * frequency`). The `sideset_base` parameter is set to the specified GPIO pin.

The PIO program itself is written in assembly language using `rp2pio.asm_pio`. It consists of a loop that toggles the state of the GPIO pin. The `wrap` instructions ensure that the program continuously loops.

We initialize the PIO program with `pio_program.init()` and set the frequency to match the desired frequency.

Finally, we activate the PIO program with `pio_program.active(1)` to start generating the square wave. The program then enters an infinite loop with `while True` to keep it running indefinitely.

This program utilizes the PIO to generate a square wave of approximately 10 kHz on the specified GPIO pin.
